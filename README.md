# 🏐 Volleyball Match Analysis – Exploratory Data Insights

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of volleyball match data to uncover patterns and performance insights related to players, teams, and match outcomes.

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze volleyball match data using Python and generate meaningful insights on:

- Player performance (attacks, blocks, serves, etc.)
- Team-level stats and win/loss patterns
- Serve accuracy and effectiveness
- Overall match outcome trends

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Insights

- Top-performing players by attack and serve success
- Team-wise win ratios and consistency over matches
- Correlation between serve accuracy and match outcome
- Visual breakdowns of points scored by skill type

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains detailed statistics from volleyball matches, including:
- Player actions (serves, attacks, blocks, digs)
- Match outcomes
- Team identifiers and roles

> *Note: Data used for analysis purposes only. Can be customized with different leagues or tournaments.*

## 📷 Sample Visualizations

- Bar plots comparing team performance  
- Heatmaps showing correlation between key metrics  
- Line graphs tracking match progression  
- Pie charts on serve success rates

## 🚀 How to Run
